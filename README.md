# CURRENTLY WORKING ON 
- Getting the two nanos to talk to each other to use the z coordnates to keep the mower straight 
    - <1> use TX -> S1, use serial port RX,TX for MPU6050
- how to use the xyz coords to move the mower with the sabertooth
    - how to make the MPU6050 dictate where the mower goes 

# FUTURE MODS
- make a web server to see the mower move in real time

# THE PLAN 
- Get a remote comtorller path where you want it to go completely, collect that data, insert that data to the microcontrollers
- Pro : the data is easy to obtain
- Con : using the data to make the mower go to those points, how do you collect the data
