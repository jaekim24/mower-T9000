# MOWER-T9000
- A sub species of the Terminators, mower T9000, which it will mow your lawn for you 

# CURRENT ISSUE
- The z axis can only be in interger range 0-255

# CURRENTLY WORKING ON 
- how to move to a target coord
- how to use the xyz coords to move the mower with the sabertooth
    - how to make the MPU6050 dictate where the mower goes 

# FUTURE MODS
- make a web server to see the mower move in real time

# THE PLAN 
- Get a remote comtorller path where you want it to go completely, collect that data, insert that data to the microcontrollers
- Pro : the data is easy to obtain
- Con : using the data to make the mower go to those points, how do you collect the data
